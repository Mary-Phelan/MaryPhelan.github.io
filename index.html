      <p class="intro">This Plugin is based on research I carried out on the consequences of the lack of censorship/moderation on social media. This research made it evident to me that some sort of a tool was needed to remind people that what they say online can affect others.  This plugin works on Reddit, Tumblr, and Facebook. It is available for download on Google Chrome and Firefox.</p>

      <h1 class="heading">How does it work?</h1>
      <p>Trigger Warning makes use of the publicly-available code structures on Reddit, Tumblr and Facebook in order to access the specific resources and actions it needs for its functionality. Actions like the amount of 'Keyup' events that occur so that the the code knows when it should run. The plugin is made up of two files: a Javascript file and a Manifest.JSON file. The JS file house all the functionality of the plugin whereas the Manifest tells the plugin where it is allowed to run and what it is in terms of a name, description and icon. This plugin is open source meaning it is designed to be publicly accessible - anyone can see, modify, and distribute the source code as they see fit.</p>

    <section class="future">
      <h1 class="heading">Future Possibilities</h1>
      <p>In the future I would like to implement the functionality on other sections of the different content creation sites, for example the comment sections. This way people could also become aware of the language they use when they are directly interacting with others.</p>
